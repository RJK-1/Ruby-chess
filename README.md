Chess game made using Ruby, challenge from The Odin Project.

This code results in a fully playable chess game on terminal.
It has been a learning curve of making classes interact,
and keeping code tidy and in relevant places using modules.

I intend to come back and keep refactoring this code. 
The code you see now is currently Revision 0.
I have included this so anyone else looking from TOP will
not be put off if they see amazing (hopefully) code in future.

I have been unable to make the code run in Replit as it removes
the colorize module which would make both sides the same colour.
I don't intend to change my code to make it work on Replit.
